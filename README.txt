# NET2008_Assignment04
Assignment 04 for NET2008 (from student latk0004)

This Python program will randomly generate two numbers for you to add together. The program will tell you if you correctly guessed the sum. You can keep guessing indefinitely until you enter "Q" to quit or close the program.

The app is a simple .py file, so you can run it by opening it anywhere that Python is installed.

Please note that the docker image must be run in interactive mode (-i) in order to use the program and input guesses.
